As an ongoing  project at the Institute of Microelectronics,  a \sdm~ has been
in development over the past few years. Our project's objective was to develop
a comprehensive  test and  data processing suite  to efficiently  and reliably
assess the performance  of various verions of these chips. In  a second stage,
the results of these measurements are to be used to further improve the \sdm's
design.

A  test  bench  has been  developed  which  allows  to  measure ten  chips  in
a  few  days  in  various configurations. The  measurement  process  has  been
largely automated  with scripts, requiring little  manual intervention. In our
project, this  has resulted  in roughly \num{4000}  measurements, representing
about \num{500000000} measurement points  and requiring approximately \num{12}
gigabytes  of storage  space. The setup  has  been documented  so that  future
groups can rebuild it and reproduce our results.
