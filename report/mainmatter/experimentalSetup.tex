\section{Putting the Sensor IC Into Operation}
\label{sec:ICintoOperation}
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- %

This  section  will  detail  the  steps  needed to  put  the  Sensor  IC  into
operation. Some  of  this  information  will be  redundant  with  the  reports
\cite{ref:burgherr},  \cite{ref:gloor} and  \cite{ref:baier},  but  we aim  to
provide a  convenient guide to  this process in  a single place,  thus sparing
future teams the effort of needing  to assemble this information from multiple
sources.\todo[noline]{Make direct references to pages/tables in other reports?}
