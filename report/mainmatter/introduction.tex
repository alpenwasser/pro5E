In his  master thesis \emph{Sensor Chip}  \cite{ref:burgherr}, Tobias Burgherr
developed a  sensor chip for converting  an analog input voltage  to a digital
output (bit  stream). Broadly speaking, the  chip consists of  a pre-amplifier
and an analog-to-digital converter.

Based on this work, two teams then each worked to improve the existing design;
one  focusing on  the  preamp  \cite{ref:gloor}, the  other  team  on the  ADC
\cite{ref:baier}.

Our primary  objective in this  project will be to  develop a test  suite with
which  to conveniently  and accurately  measure the  various versions  of this
chip.  While some measurements have already  been performed on the first chip,
the amount of tests run was limited  due to time constraints by the respective
teams.  We aim to expand on those measurements with our test suite, as well as
to use them as a reference point against which we can compare our findings.

Once the  two new  chips become  available, the methodology  used in  our test
suite will allow efficient and accurate measuring  of the two new chips in our
next project.

This  report  focuses  primarily  on measurements  and  results  analysis. For
this  reason, no  extensive theoretical  chapters are  provided, and  we refer
the  reader  to  the  reports  by  the  preceding  teams  \cite{ref:burgherr},
\cite{ref:gloor} and \cite{ref:baier} as well as textbooks.

Chapter  \ref{chap:testBench}  presents an  overview  of  the system  hardware
and  software,  and details  how  to  put  the setup  into  operation. Chapter
\ref{chap:measurements} contains a description  of measurement methodology and
rationale,  answering  the questions  ''\emph{What  did  we measure,  how  and
why?}``. In  Chapter \ref{chap:results},  the results  are presented. Finally,
Chapter \ref{chap:conclusions}  presents our conclusions, which  will form the
basis for further work in our bachelor thesis.
