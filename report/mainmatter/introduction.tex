In his  master thesis \emph{Sensor Chip}  \cite{ref:burgherr}, Tobias Burgherr
developed a  sensor chip for converting  an analog input voltage  to a digital
output (bitstream). Broadly speaking, the chip consists of a pre-amplifier and
an analog-to-digital converter.

Based on this work, two teams then each worked to improve the existing design;
one  focusing on  the  preamp  \cite{ref:gloor}, the  other  team  on the  ADC
\cite{ref:baier}.

While some measurements and test have  been made, the preceding groups focused
on what  they needed  to measure  to accomplish the  tasks at  hand. Our first
objective in this  project is therefore to perform a  comprehensive test suite
on the  existing chip from  \cite{ref:burgherr}. The results from  these tests
will be compared with simulations, allowing us to draw conclusions for further
improvements. Focus  will also  be  placed on  detailed  documentation of  the
experimental  setup to  ease reproduction  of  our results  by future  student
teams.

This  project's results  will  form the  basis  for our  further  work in  our
Bachelor Thesis.
